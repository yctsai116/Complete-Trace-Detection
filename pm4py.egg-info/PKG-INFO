Description: Welcome to Process Mining for Python!
        
        PM4Py is a python library that supports (state-of-the-art) process mining algorithms in python. It is completely open source and intended to be used in both academia and industry projects.
        
        The official website of the library is http://pm4py.org/
        
        You can always check out (changes to) the source code at the github repo.
        
        A very simple example, to whet your appetite:
        
        from pm4py.algo.discovery.alpha import factory as alpha_miner
        from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import factory as xes_importer
        from pm4py.visualization.petrinet import factory as vis_factory
        
        log = xes_importer.import_log('<path-to-xes-log-file>')
        net, initial_marking, final_marking = alpha_miner.apply(log)
        gviz = vis_factory.apply(net, initial_marking, final_marking)
        vis_factory.view(gviz)
